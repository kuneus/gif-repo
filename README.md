# gif-repo

This is a storage place for GIFs for use by other repos.

# Purpose

By creating a separate repo for storing GIFs, this enables easy storage of GIFs while bypassing the constraints of hosting externally (limited GIF size <10mb) or adding unnecessary bloat to the primary repo.

Thus, to use a GIF from this repo, simply copy its URL for use in its intended repo.
